Subject: Pending dues- Regarding. 

Hope you are keeping well and enjoying your online learning experience. 

It has been informed by the accounts section that you have yet not cleared your dues against the fees. 

It was earlier decided not to allow the students, in whose respect dues are pending, to appear in the end-term examinations.
 
The matter has been reviewed and taking a lenient view, it has now been decided to allow such students to appear in the end-term examinations subject to the furnishing of an undertaking that the balance dues will be cleared latest by December 15, 2020. 

However, it is also made clear that your answer sheets for declaration of results will be evaluated only after balance dues have been cleared. 

You are accordingly advised to mail a request, as per draft attached, to HoD of your Department.  

With best wishes 
Vice Chancellor 

*Draft of the mail to be sent to the HoDs*

I also understand that my answer sheets will be evaluated for declaration of results only after balance dues have been cleared.

With humble regards

Yours Sincerely

Good morning!
Please don't create a confusion in your mind. The primary purpose of this 15 day project is to clear your views on which technology you want to work.

Once you will have a mini Project list at that time you will confident to choose project based on your own interest not based on your friends interest.

For example.
If you missed something in your 3rd sem project. You want to complete that in 15 days. It is Ok, but that time I need complete.

If web development that means both front + back end.

We are available to help you.
Even if you have any doubt kindly message me.

The student who attended our previous session they know very well what is my point.

If they are not doing anything / No idea about the project then why they are not communicating with the teachers.

14/02/21, 07:55 - Saumitro Sir: 13.02.2021
My dear Students (All Students except first year)
 
It is in continuation to email dated February 03, 2021 vide which it was informed that February 20,2021 onwards classes will be held only in the offline mode.
 
The decision was taken keeping in view the larger interest of the students and appreciating the significance of the practicals, labs and projects to enable students to grow as sound professionals with critical thinking and  problem solving skills.
 
Few parents have expressed concern about the Covid safety of their wards. In this regard, it is informed that the University has adopted all safety norms in the Academic, Campus and Hostels as per UGC guidelines.
 
However, appreciating the concern of the parents, it has been decided to continue with online classes also in addition to classes in the physical mode. However, I would advise you in your own interest to attend classes in the physical mode.
 
Kindly note that as informed earlier the mid-term examinations scheduled during March 08 to March 13, 2021 and final examinations scheduled during May17 to June 12, 2021 will be held only in the offline mode at the University campus.

 
Stay safe, Stay healthy.
 
With best wishes
Prof Sanjay Jasola

This is with reference to the Career Skills mid term exam to be conducted in the labs.

It was observed yesterday that many students did not remember their login credentials on the exam portal as they have a habit of taking the exam on their phone or laptop where the credentials are saved.

*It is hereby requested that all students of the concerned semesters in your departments may be instructed to login once to the exam portal to check or to definitely carry their login credentials when they come for the exam.*

The same challenge will happen in GE paper also and so it is better to be prepared in advance.

Dear Team,

Greetings from Nagarro!!

As you know that in today‚Äôs world, it is important to be prepared for the future and it would be better if while being in college only the students groom themselves for tough challenges that are in store for them in near future.

Going by the industry trend and preparing the students for future challenges, we have come up with a Monthly coding challenge ‚ÄòCodSule‚Äô to give students a platform to enhance their coding skills.

CodSule gives them the exact same opportunity where they can:

    Do what they love ‚Äì CODE
    Opportunity to grab internship or job offers with Nagarro (if performed exceptionally good)
    Get participation certificates and goodies.

This will be a monthly contest where the students will have to attempt the challenge.

April contest of CodSule is on 24th April i.e., Saturday at 08:00 PM to 11:00PM.

To register, students need to fill this form- https://forms.office.com/r/MMqfA3AgsB

Note: Only the students registering through the above link will be getting the contest link.

Team Codsule

It is in continuation to this office order No. GEHU/033/Acad/13/N.O/2021/58 dated May 04, 2021. 

Issue regarding Transportation fee and Sports fee has been reviewed in the light of worsening Corona scenario.  

Keeping in view that it may take time to start offline classes, it has been decided that these charges will not be included in the fees for this semester. 

The decision about charging of these fees  on pro rata basis will be taken as and when the classes commence  in the offline mode and these facilities are made available to the students.

It is observed that few students have already paid these charges. It is informed that this amount will be adjusted in the fee of forthcoming semester.

29/05/21, 19:33 - Saumitro Sir: Every person in the world has a story to tell. Stories of hope, pain, passion, dedication, and survival! Stories- that not only have the power to amuse, excite, amaze but also teach! 

Graphic Era is fortunate to have fostered many gems whose stories are capable of inspiring to the extent that one will be motivated to create his own saga! 

We feel delighted to bring such stories to you in our ‚ÄòINSIDE SUCCESS‚Äô series. Through this series, we intend to provide students a closer look into the lives and journeys of the prodigies who are a part of the Graphic Era family. 

We shall be beginning this expedition with Deepak Singh. 

Deepak is a student of B.Tech (CSE), GEU 2018-2021 batch who has secured placement in top-notch companies like Z-scaler, Amazon, and Microsoft.

Like we all know, this is not the whole story! There are so many facets of his journey which have not been illuminated, his approach to life or studies, for instance. (believe us, these are some pretty important aspects!) With this series, we intend to fill these gaps through the medium of a live interactive session with the man himself!

So, rest of you will get 0 marks in phase 1 of Moocs, and hopefully may be not allowed to give phase 2 and phase 3 of Moocs as well, as the topic is only not taken till now, even after giving plenty of time to you. It's all your responsibility now to earn marks or get 0 in Moocs Seminar. I will check at 12 am midnight tomorrow, whatever entries will be there, I will evaluate, and rest of you will not be allowed at all after that. And I will also not remind you now of the last date and time. It's all your responsibility to do it or get 0.

8. The marks that you will be get will be final. No re-test will be conducted *in any case*.

As part of this challenge, we take a few selected students from some of the prestigious colleges of India, such as Graphic Era Institute of Technology and train them on the concepts of the IoT and ML / Web Development, which is followed by a project competition between them to choose the most innovative students from India. Please note that students from all four years of engineering are eligible to participate in the Innovation Challenge.
 

The competition will be judged by some of the experts who have worked at organizations like Amazon, Larsen & Toubro Infotech, etc. The competition will be an excellent opportunity for students to showcase their talent and skills at an All-India level.


To participate, the students will have to answer any one of the scholarship tests below:

Web Development Training Scholarship: https://info.boltiot.com/webdevelopmentscholarship
Internet of Things and Machine Learning Scholarship: https://info.boltiot.com/iotmlscholarship

What are the prizes for the students?
1st Place: Cash prize of Rs. 30,000/-
2nd Place: Cash prize of Rs. 20,000/-
3rd Place: Cash prize of Rs.10,000/-

Consolation prizes: 2 Amazon Echo Dots

What are the steps for Bolt's Innovation Challenge?

Step 1: Students will have to answer a scholarship test and qualify for the same by scoring at least 70% marks. This is a short test and will not take more than 10 minutes for the students. This ensures that they can answer it without spending much time if they have exams ongoing.
The selected students will be eligible to join either of Bolt's trainings at an 80% discount. We charge a small fee to cover our costs and to ensure that only interested students join the program.
To answer the scholarship, students have to visit either of the following links. They can choose to answer either of the two scholarship tests based on the training they want to take up. They could also opt for both:

Web Development Training: Scholarship link https://info.boltiot.com/webdevelopmentscholarship
Internet of Things and Machine Learning Training: Scholarship link https://info.boltiot.com/iotmlscholarship

Step 2: Our team of developers will train the students on the concepts of the training. Upon completion of the training, each student will be issued a certificate which can be submitted to the college/university as per the AICTE rules.
Step 3: The students have to build an innovative project in the area of IoT and ML or Web Development by applying the learnings of the training.
Step 4: The winners will be judged by engineers who have worked at prestigious organizations like Amazon, Larsen & Toubro Infotech, etc.

Why should students participate?
Internship opportunities: Upon training completion, students are also eligible for internship opportunities. You can get more details here: https://info.boltiot.com/internshipopportunities.
Certification: Upon completion of the training, the students will be issued a certificate that can be submitted to the college/university as per the AICTE rules.
Opportunity to build hands-on projects: As a part of the training, students will complete multiple hands-on projects, that also involve an industrial project.
Support to resolve queries throughout the training: In case the students are stuck at any point, we offer support via forum, email and if required, also via phone call and screen share.
Deadline to register:
The last date to avail of the scholarship and register for the Innovation Challenge is TOMORROW, 24th of August 2021. Keeping this in mind, please inform your students about the scholarship and competition at the earliest.

The new content related to PCS 505 Design and analysis of algorithms lab will now be available on new server only.

29/08/21, 21:00 - Aastha mam: *Important announcement*

*Regarding Design and analysis of algorithms lab (DAA Lab) PCS 505*

1. The students who are getting access on moodle recently they can submit their pending assignments (DAA Lab) 1-5 on the old moodle server. I will consider them.

2. From assignment 6 onwards, the assignments will be in the form of hacker earth tests only. So it is compulsory to attempt the hacker earth tests now as each test will carry marks.

3. No assignment will be given on moodle as far as DAA lab is concerned.

4. All the students will be able to give the hackerearth test as the link is sent on their mails irrespective of the fact that you have moodle access or not. So in case anyone misses the test they will held entirely responsible for that.

5. Do attempt the tests seriously as eventually both the mid semester and end semester lab exam will be conducted on hacker earth.

6. The tests will have a longer avail duration and can be attempted between the specified dates so students can attempt the test in a flexible manner.

Registration Deadline: 22 Oct'21 11:59 PM IST

Tata Group for the first time has opened the doors of Tata Administrative Services (TAS), an IAS equivalent of the private sector via Tata Imagination Challenge to all the students across domains.
TAS, Tata Group's flagship leadership development program, was conceived by the legendary JRD Tata in 1956 as an elite service of young managers when he observed that there were people with impressive business acumen, but were limited by education or experience. Today the Tata Group has 30 companies in over 100+ countries and TAS Managers are leading it at every front and now they have opened their doors again to hire TAS Managers of batch 2022.

Link to Apply: https://dare2compete.com/competition/tata-imagination-challenge-2021-tata-sons-213975?refId=TICSuy

Eligibility: 
Every student enrolled in a full-time course across India and across domains - Engineering, Business, Arts, Commerce, Science, CA, etc. 

Apply now if you think you can be that leader who can take the Tata group to greater heights because the Tata group is more than a company and TAS is more than just a job.

Thank you.
